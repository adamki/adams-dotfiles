## About
ðŸ‘‹ This repo contains scripts to bootstrap my tools of choice and take care as much of the setup process as possible.

## Getting Started
_**Pre-Requisites**_: Set up your `.ssh` keys
```
$ git clone git@github.com:adamki/dotfiles.git $HOME/dotfiles
$ cd $HOME/dotfiles
$ chmod +x install/install.sh
```

This Installation script will:
* Install technologies listed [here](#technologies-included)
* Move all old configuration files into a directory called `~/${USER}/dotfiles`
* Symlink new configuration files in `${HOME}` directory to `{USER}/dotfiles`
* Will set your default shell to Zsh
