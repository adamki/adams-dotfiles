* Be sure to Download Iterm here:

* I use `Plug` to manage vim dependencies. Be sure to install it first
```
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

* I also use `Karabiner` to handle CAPS lock key binding. download it here:
